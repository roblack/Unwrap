# Unwrap
**Copyright (c) 2019 Paul Hudson**

My hope is to release Unwrap under an open source license at some point, partly so that folks can use this code to build their own apps, and partly because it means anyone can help improve this app for everyone.

However, until the app has actually shipped to the App Store I need to be careful: I don’t want folks to release my code before I do, because that’s just likely to confuse users and probably cause problems because there are bugs or glaring mistakes.

So, right now here’s the license:

- You can read through all my code and learn all you want. Please do!

- You may not redistribute any part of the code, commercially or otherwise.

- You may not use any part of the content, commercially or otherwise. “Content” means all the non-code materials, such as the videos or JSON files.

- If you want to help work on this now by all means fork it on GitHub, make changes, and open pull requests. However, any commit to this repository implicitly allows me to relicense your contribution to any OSI-approved license without prior consent, while also granting me permission to ship the code in a finished product.

That last clause is important, and is inspired by the [VLC team](https://github.com/videolan/vlc-ios/blob/master/COPYING) – if you intend to help with this project, it’s really important you understand its implications fully.

Normally changing a license means contacting every contributor and asking their permission for the change, but that clause means if you open pull requests here then you’re giving me permission to switch to a real open-source license at any point in the future without asking you.

You can find the full list of OSI-approved licenses at <https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical> – the Open Source Initiative curates that list very carefully, so you can be sure whatever license(s) I choose will definitely be open-source compatible.

Trust me: I know this license sucks, and I want to make it better. But at the same time I don’t want confused users, half-baked clones, or lots of negative reviews because the app was shipped before it was ready.

Please bear with me while I continue to refine what’s here and get it live. If you have questions or suggestions please get in touch: I’m [@twostraws on Twitter](https://twitter.com/twostraws), or you can email <paul@hackingwithswift.com>.

**Note:** If you have suggestions for how I can make this better for everyone, please get in touch!
